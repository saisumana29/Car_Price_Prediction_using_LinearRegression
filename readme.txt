The code is used to predict the price of a car based on various features.
 The first line imports all the necessary libraries that are required for data analysis and machine learning.
 Next, we load the dataset into a pandas dataframe using `pd.read_csv()` function.
 This allows us to easily manipulate and analyze the data.
 Then, we use `df.head()` function to display the first 5 rows of our dataset.
 This gives us an idea about how our data looks like.
 We then check for any missing values in our dataset using `df.isnull().sum()`.
 If there are any missing values, we can handle them accordingly before proceeding with further analysis.
 Next, we use `df.describe()` function to get some basic statistical information about our numerical columns such as mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values etc.
 This helps us understand the distribution of our data and identify any outliers or anomalies that may affect our model performance.
 After that, we plot a histogram for each numerical column using `sns.distplot()` function from seaborn library.
 Histograms give us an idea about the distribution of each feature which is important when building regression models.
 To visualize relationships between different variables in our dataset, we create a correlation matrix using `df.corr()` function and then plot it as a heatmap using seaborn's `sns.heatmap()` function.
 Correlation matrix shows how strongly each variable is related to other variables in terms of magnitude and direction (positive or negative).
 Heatmap makes it easier to interpret this information by assigning different colors based on correlation strength.
 In order to build a linear regression model later on, we need to split our dataset into training set and test set so that we can evaluate its performance on unseen data points.
 We do this by calling sklearn's train_test_split() method which randomly splits the original dataframe into two subsets - one for training (80% of total) and another for testing (20
 The code imports various libraries and modules for data analysis and machine learning, sets the default style for plots, and imports a linear regression model from sklearn.
